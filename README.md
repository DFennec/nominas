# Nominas
### Payroll management project built in TKinter with an embedded SQLite database to keep track of employees and their data, as well as to make a few basic statistics regarding employment within the company.
`Note: bear in mind that this project was built for a subject taught in Spanish and, as such, its menus are in Spanish.`

As it is apparent, the program has 4 main menus with its corresponding options. Below you may find a rundown of what each of these 4 menus do.
## ALTAS
  This menu acts as a form that allows the user to insert employees into the company database.
